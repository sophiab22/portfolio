           The goal of this academic project was to develop a book proposal for a potential Canadian author. Our group decided to choose YouTube gaming personality, Evan Fong, who hosts the popular channel VanossGaming. Since we observed a trend of popular YouTube stars releasing their own book, we discovered publishing companies are targeting the young millennials who admire these personalities. We thought Evan Fong would be the perfect candidate to become our author because he could attract the video game streaming community and share his experience of hosting one. Monochrome Publishing’s (our team name) book, <em>Dare To Stream</em>, is about a biography of a gaming YouTuber who talks about his experience and explains his techniques and discusses what lies ahead for corporations and future business.

          My role in this project was to research the demographic area of VanossGaming, co-write the illustrative features of Evan Fong and design the book proposal document. One challenge we faced was understanding our author. When comparing our competition of other YouTube personalities whom like to share almost everything about their lives, Evan Fong was more reserved and stayed true to the brand and content. We watched some of his older videos and read journalistic articles to find interesting contributions Fong has participated in.

          When it came to designing the cover of <em>Dare To Stream</em>, my goal was to characterize Fong and the essence of his channel. We wanted to retain some branding elements from the VanossGaming channel. In a majority of the channel’s thumbnails, there is a consistent rainbow gradient. Also, Fong and some of his friends featured have specific characters associated to themselves that fans really enjoy. Particularly, Evan is an owl character called “Hoodini” showcased in his <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series and animated videos. In my first iteration, my feedback was based on hierarchy and typography issues and also lacked the quality of potentially being sold in stores. Going back to the drawing board, I looked back into the design and decided to cartoonize Fong and modified the type. However the appeal still wasn’t there. After a couple of rounds of trial and error, I realized that overlaying the title over his eyes provided that air of mystery to his audience.
