          Our animated story is about a ghost, Boo, who tries to scare a little girl, Amy. However, Amy is unimpressed by the scare tactics Boo is trying to use and tries to teach him instead.

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>
           We began with the concept of a ghost who wants to scare someone but doesn’t know how. Our story of Boo was inspired by Pixar’s <em>Monster’s Inc</em> and <em>Casper the Friendly Ghost</em>. After we came up with the story, we developed a storyboard and describing character and environment schemes. I began sketching out how are protagonists would look like. After we received feedback from our peers and instructors, we realized that we lacked multiple camera angles and our pacing was a little too fast. We also implemented more exaggerated facial expressions for our protagonists to give them a cartoon appeal. Our final animation reflected and applied all the feedback we received.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>

          <p>
            Since I was more comfortable with modeling than animating, I decided to take charge of remodelling the 3 environments: the exterior house, Amy’s bedroom, and the playroom. I was responsible for effectively texturing and properly light each setting to convey a tone and atmosphere. For our first team assignment, I was in charge of modeling a sub-urban house. Since I was completely new to Maya’s interface, I used simple polygonal shapes and extrusions to construct a house while using a reference photo. One tricky situation I came across was lighting. When you render a frame from Maya, the results become darker than usual. Also, since this was setting in the night, I had to consider light from point sources like lamps, house lights and the moonlight; and also increase the brightness of ambient lights. Despite still being dark, Photoshop was to the rescue by applying multiple layers of of texture and adjustment of the lighting. Since this particular assignment only needed a render still frame, it ended up becoming a conceptual art piece of our story while the actual model was modified and used for the final animation.

        <p>
          I did dabble a little on the animation portion too. I focused on animating a small portion of the playroom where Amy tries to teach Boo how to be scary. I also created various facial expressions for Boo on Photoshop. However, one major issue was figuring out how to apply the facial expressions to Amy. The problem was that the faces glitched and did not properly matched the movements of the model. I tried multiple approaches in order to solve the problem. It suddenly hit me that it looked like there was an overlapping of textures and multiple nodes of “planar” and “automatic” mapping. After deleting the history, reapplying the texture on the entire ‘Amy’ polygon and recoloring her, her faces stop glitching making keyframing her animations go smoothly.

        <h3>Reflections</h3>
        <p>
          This entire project introduced us to the concepts of the 3D building software Maya. I realized that I really enjoyed the modeling process of the environments and would not mind doing it sometime in the future. I feel like I have improved on my eye on how to apply good lighting and texturing to convey a mood. There are numerous usages of the Working on this animation project makes me appreciate the effort and time long-term animators put into their work to create masterpieces.
