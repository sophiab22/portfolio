          2Lend is a conceptual mobile application that promotes sharing economies by trading tools with neighbors and friends. Our design domain is about sharing economies which supports peer-to-peer services of sharing goods. Our goal was to encourage users to save money and increase resource efficiency. 

        <p>
          My contribution is co-designing parts of the prototype. Based off our research, we identified that pre-existing tool sharing services, such as <em>ShareMyToolbox</em> where the interface was overwhelming amount of elements and had a weak navigation. When developing the prototype, we wanted to ensure an easy access to all pages with a minimal interface. One of the challenges our group faced was how the application communicated information. For example, we went through several iterations of different types of interactions. In our wireframes, our priority was to test out which navigation (“hamburger” menu icon or the bottom tabs) was the most accessible. After some user testing, we concluded that tabs were adequate to show our main features we wanted to include. Designing our first mockups, engaged in a language issue.  The section “Due Soon” brought up confusion as to whether the user was waiting for an item to be returned or if the item the user is borrowing was getting close to the deadline. After multiple considerations and testing, we collaboratively decided that a drop-down would be an efficient way to sort out this confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I learned from developing this application is that every interaction and communication is very important to engage in the issues of developing a design.
